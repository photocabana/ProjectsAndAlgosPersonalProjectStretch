# ProjectsAndAlgosPersonalProjectStretch

This solo project was created with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js)

to import npm i on both the server & client sides in your terminal
to run on the server side -   nodemon server.js
to run on the client side -   npm run dev

This is a website for my company RHFDesignsOnline that I created in 2020. I had purchased a domain for it, but was never able to create an online storefront until now.
Please enjoy.
There will be more to come in the near future.
